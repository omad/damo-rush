# Dino-Rush
Dino-Rush allow to create custom problems deck of any size and any difficulty for the game rush-hour.

The dinosaur theme, used as a mean to differentiate multiple deck, has been chosen quite arbitrary because dinosaur are cool!

# Limitation known
The size of the input svg in the repo and some constant in the code are specificaly chosen and hardcoded, as the generated image will be printed on a specific sized card.

I aim to use [printerstudio](www.printerstudio.com) for this, with the 'bridge' size card.

I didn't reuse/code a solver as IÂ feel that having the solution printed on the back of the card is pretty useless. This also free the place and allow me to print twice more problems per deck !

# Usage
## Dependancy installation
```sh
pip3 install --upgrade --user cairosvg pillow
```

## Graphics generation
This needs to be done once initialy and everytime you change the svg graphics or add one:
```sh
./generate_graphics.py
```

## Standalon card
Makes a random card show up:
```sh
./mkcard.py
```

Same but chose number of move required (must be <= 60):
```sh
./mkcard.py --level 42
```
## Deck generation
TODO

# Credits
See dedicated file [here](credits.md).

The credits are separated to allow the automatic rendering of a specific card with credits on the deck.
